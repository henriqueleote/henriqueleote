I'm a passionate software developer based in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹, originally from Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹. Currently, I work as a software developer at Papyrus Software in Austria 🇦🇹, where I get to work on exciting projects and collaborate with talented teams.

## Background and Education

- 🌱 I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving world of software development. I enjoy working on side projects during my free time to expand my skills and experiment with new ideas.

- 💡 I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and create positive impacts. I believe in the power of software development to drive innovation and improve people's lives.

- 🔍 My main focus is web and mobile development, but over the past few weeks, I have been exploring the world of Telegram bot development using Python. This new venture aims to enhance my lifestyle and broaden my skill set.

- 🎨 I love to travel to different cultures, as I've explored most of Europe. Love to play sports, hang out with friends and watch movies. Also, development wouldn't be possible without Music 🎵.
